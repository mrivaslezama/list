# Detailed Ruby on Rails Project Setup for List Management

## 1. Project Initialization
- Create a new Rails project named “lista_management” with PostgreSQL:
  ```
  rails new lista_management -d postgresql
  cd lista_management
  ```
- Configure the `database.yml` file to use PostgreSQL for development, test, and production databases.
- Perform any initial commits to version control (e.g., Git).

## 2. Model and Scaffold Generation
- Add the following dependencies to the Gemfile:
  ```
  gem 'devise'
  gem 'image_processing'
  gem 'pg'
  ```
- Install the gems:
  ```
  bundle install
  ```
- Generate Devise User model:
  ```
  rails generate devise:install
  rails generate devise User
  ```
- Generate the List scaffold, including references to the User model:
  ```
  rails generate scaffold List \
    name:string \
    last_name:string \
    rut:string \
    email:string \
    phone:string \
    location:string \
    done:boolean \
    user:references
  ```
- Migrate the database:
  ```
  rails db:create
  rails db:migrate
  ```

## 3. Configure Relationships and Validations
- In the `app/models/user.rb` file, establish one-to-many or many-to-many relationships with the List model as appropriate.
- Add form validations to the List model (e.g., presence, format validations).
- Configure Active Storage if an avatar upload is required, and ensure the relevant gem (e.g., `image_processing`) is installed.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization
- Use Devise for user sign-up, login, password management, and email confirmation.
- Enforce that only authenticated users can create or edit lists.
- Outline role-based access controls (e.g., admin vs regular user) in the controllers or with Pundit/Cancancan if needed.

## 5. Front-end and UX
- Install and configure Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling. For example, with Bootstrap:
  ```
  yarn add bootstrap
  ```
  and import it in your application stylesheet.
- Update views for List and Devise to be responsive.
- Provide user-friendly forms with client-side validations or placeholders.

## 6. Security Practices
- Enforce strong passwords with Devise’s built-in password strength options or custom validations.
- Sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Hide sensitive environment variables from public repositories by storing them securely (e.g., using Rails credentials or environment variables).

## 7. Deployment Preparation
- Configure `database.yml` and production configuration for Render or another host.
- Set up environment variables for production (e.g., SECRET_KEY_BASE, DB credentials).
- Commit and push code to source control (e.g., GitHub).

## 8. Render Deployment Steps
1. Create a new Web Service in Render.
2. Connect to your GitHub repository.
3. Add build commands (e.g., “bundle install”) and run migrations with “rails db:migrate”.
4. Configure environment variables (SECRET_KEY_BASE, RAILS_MASTER_KEY, etc.).
5. Add a free PostgreSQL instance on Render if needed, and update credentials as environment variables.
6. Deploy to confirm a successful build and deploy.

Following these steps will guide your team through creating an authenticated List Management system with secure user access, front-end styling, and a smooth deployment workflow.
